## Machine Learning Specialization — Course Highlights

### Course 1 · Supervised Machine Learning: Regression & Classification
- Built end-to-end predictive models in Python with **NumPy** and **scikit-learn**  
- Implemented and evaluated **linear regression** for continuous targets and **logistic regression** for binary-classification tasks

### Course 2 · Advanced Learning Algorithms
- Designed and trained multi-class **neural networks** using **TensorFlow**
- Followed industry best practices—data partitioning, regularization, and systematic error analysis—to ensure real-world generalization
- Developed tree-based learners: **decision trees**, **random forests**, and **gradient-boosted trees**

### Course 3 · Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders & Reinforcement Learning
- Applied unsupervised techniques—**clustering** and **anomaly detection**—to uncover hidden structure in unlabeled data
- Built recommendation engines via **collaborative filtering** and deep **content-based** methods
- Implemented a deep **reinforcement-learning** agent that learns optimal policies through interaction
